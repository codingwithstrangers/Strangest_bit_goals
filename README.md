### Strangest_Bit_Goals

### What is This?

This is a template for creating Twitch widget goals. This works for Streamlabs OBS. The goal was put a gif or an icon, on the bar that moves as your actual followes, sub, and etch go up. Feel free to go to my stream and test it out. 

### Why Did I Do This?

Its cool and the visual will make your stream goals standout.

### How Users Can Use This

**For Users:**
**For Programmers:**
- I used vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS—no frameworks. I know, right?
- You can replace all images and links.
- Check the "Bugs" section for any issues I’m aware of.
- The JS code handles data retrieval and DOM manipulation.

- External Resources: Google Fonts and Font Awesome are imported for fonts and icons.
- HTML Structure: A progress bar setup with accompanying elements for displaying a goal, current progress, and a related image.
- CSS: Styling ensures a visually appealing layout with consistent fonts, aligned elements, and smooth progress bar animations.
- JavaScript: Event listeners handle loading the goal data and updating the display as the current progress changes, with a condition to mark the goal as complete when reached.
- Triggers when the current amount of bits changes.
- Updates the current and total bit amounts displayed on the screen.
- Adjusts the progress bar width to reflect the new percentage of progress.
- Again, if the goal is met, the text updates to "Complete."
